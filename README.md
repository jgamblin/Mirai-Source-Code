## 🔧 Requirements

Before building and running this code, ensure you have the following installed on a **Linux host**:

- `gcc` - GNU Compiler Collection
- `golang` - Go programming language
- `electric-fence` - Memory debugging library
- `mysql-server` - MySQL database server
- `mysql-client` - MySQL database client
- `build-essential` - Essential build tools
- `crossbuild-essential-armel` - Cross-compilation tools for ARM

**Additional Resources:**
- For detailed setup instructions and background information, refer to the original leak post in `ForumPost.txt` or view the formatted version at [ForumPost.md](ForumPost.md).


⚠️ **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**  
This repository contains the leaked source code of the **Mirai botnet**, originally created to infect IoT devices and launch large-scale DDoS attacks. This code is provided **strictly for cybersecurity research, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and detection development purposes only**.

**⚠️ WARNING: Do not use this code to attack or scan any real devices or networks. Unauthorized use is illegal and violates GitHub policy.**

**🛡️ SECURITY NOTICE:** The [zip file](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/f10667215040e87dae62dd48a5405b3b1b0fe7dbbfbf790d5300f3cd54893333/analysis/1477822491/) for this repo is being identified by some AV programs as malware. Please take caution.

## 📌 About Mirai

Mirai is a malware botnet that infects Internet of Things (IoT) devices using default or weak login credentials. Once infected, these devices are controlled by a command-and-control (CnC) server and can be used to launch DDoS attacks.

This repo is a fork of the original leaked source code and includes components such as:
- The bot (runs on IoT devices)
- The CnC server
- The loader (infects devices)
- Scanning and deployment scripts

## ⚙️ How to Use (FOR LAB RESEARCH ONLY)

> You must use **isolated VMs** or an offline network. Never run this on a real device or public network.

### 🔧 1. Prerequisites

Install on a **Linux host**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc make build-essential git crossbuild-essential-armel -y
```

## 🔨 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code.git
cd Mirai-Source-Code
```

## 🔨 3. Build the Bot and CnC

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:

*  Cross-compile the bot for different IoT architectures (MIPS, ARM, etc.)

*  Compile the CnC server for your local machine

You can customize the build script and source code paths if needed.

## 🧪 4. Setup a Test Lab (Recommended)

Create a virtual lab with:

*  1 Ubuntu VM for CnC and loader

*  1 or more OpenWRT/Linux VMs simulating IoT devices

Use Host-Only or Internal Networking mode to keep the lab isolated.

## 🕹 5. Running Components

*  Start the CnC server (mirai/cnc/cnc)

*  Run the loader to infect virtual IoT VMs

*  Observe communication logs, infection, and payload delivery

## ✅ Learning Use Cases

You can use this source code to:

*  Understand how botnets spread through weak credentials

*  Reverse engineer malware behavior

*  Write intrusion detection rules (YARA, Snort, Suricata)

*  Develop antivirus and botnet defenses

*  Study CnC-to-bot protocol and build simulators

## ❌ Do NOT Use For

*  Scanning or infecting real IoT devices

*  DDoS attacks

*  Deploying the bot to the public internet

Any such use is illegal and against GitHub policy.
