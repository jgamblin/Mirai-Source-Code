‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**  
This repository contains the leaked source code of the **Mirai botnet**, originally created to infect IoT devices and launch large-scale DDoS attacks. This code is provided **strictly for cybersecurity research, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and detection development purposes only**.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**      
Do Not Use This Code To Attack or Scan Any Real Devices or Networks. Unauthorized Use Is Illegal and Violates GitHub Policy.

**üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY NOTICE**

# About Mirai

Mirai is a malware botnet that infects Internet of Things (IoT) devices using default or weak login credentials. Once infected, these devices are controlled by a command-and-control (CnC) server and can be used to launch DDoS attacks.

This repo is a fork of the original leaked source code and includes components such as:
- The bot (runs on IoT devices)
- The CnC server
- The loader (infects devices)
- Scanning and deployment scripts

# How to Use (FOR LAB RESEARCH ONLY)

>  <span style="color:red"><b> ‚ö†Ô∏èYou must use **isolated VMs** or an offline network. Never run this on a real device or public network. </b></span>

## 1. Prerequisites

Install on a **Linux host**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc make build-essential git crossbuild-essential-armel -y
```

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code.git
cd Mirai-Source-Code
```

## 3. Build the Bot and CnC

```bash
./build.sh
```

**This will:**

* Cross-compile the bot for different IoT architectures (MIPS, ARM, etc.)

* Compile the CnC server for your local machine

You can customize the build script and source code paths if needed.

## 4. Setup a Test Lab (Recommended)

Create a virtual lab with:

* 1 Ubuntu VM for CnC and loader

* 1 or more OpenWRT/Linux VMs simulating IoT devices

Use Host-Only or Internal Networking mode to keep the lab isolated.

## 5. Running Components

* Start the CnC server (mirai/cnc/cnc)

* Run the loader to infect virtual IoT VMs

* Observe communication logs, infection, and payload delivery

# Learning Use Cases

You can use this source code to:

* Understand how botnets spread through weak credentials

* Reverse engineer malware behavior

* Write intrusion detection rules (YARA, Snort, Suricata)

* Develop antivirus and botnet defenses

* Study CnC-to-bot protocol and build simulators

# Implications Not To Use For

*  Scanning or infecting real IoT devices

*  DDoS attacks

*  Deploying the bot to the public internet

 >   <span style="color:red"><b>‚ö†Ô∏è Any Such Use Is Illegal and Against GitHub Policy.</b></span>
